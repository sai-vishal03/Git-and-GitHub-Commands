Git and GitHub Commands for Beginners

This repository contains a concise guide to essential Git and GitHub commands. Here's a quick overview of what you'll find:

Initializing Repositories:

git init initializes a new Git repository for tracking changes in a project.
Staging, Committing, and Viewing Changes:

git status checks the state of files, git add <file> stages changes, and git commit -m saves changes to the repository.
Use git log or git log --oneline to view the commit history.
Working with Versions:

git checkout <commit ID> moves to a previous version, while git revert <commit ID> safely undoes a commit.
git reset <commit ID> --hard permanently deletes commits and changes.
Branching:

Create new branches with git branch <branch name>, switch branches with git checkout, and use git branch -a to see all branches.
Merging and Deleting Branches:

Merge branches into the master branch with git merge <branch name> and delete branches using git branch -D <branch name>.
Working with GitHub:

git remote add origin <repo URL> sets the GitHub repository, while git push origin master uploads changes. Use git clone <repo URL> to download repositories.
Other Useful Commands:

Remove staged files with git rm --cached, stash changes temporarily using git stash, and sync with remote changes via git fetch or git pull.
This guide covers everything from creating branches and reverting changes to working with GitHub repositories, ensuring you can confidently use Git in real-world projects.
